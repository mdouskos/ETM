## Earth Time Machine

This is the website of the Earth Time Machine research project.

The main goal of the project is to develop a system for automated 4D reconstruction and mapping of an area of interest through the combined consideration of multi-temporal, multi-modal and multi-scale data from various platforms and sensors. The produced models are a valuable source of information for studying complex social and natural phenomena and they provide the ability to disseminate relevant scientific results to the general public.

The project is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund) through the Operational Program "Human Resource Development, Education and Lifelong Learning", in the context of the Act "SUPPORT OF POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHERS - 2nd cycle" (MIS 5033021) implemented by the  Greek State Scholarships Foundation ([IKY](https://www.iky.gr/en/)).
